To connect this html to the app route made by using flask and flask sql alchemy in python, you need to do the following steps:

- Import Flask and SQLAlchemy modules in your python file.
- Create an instance of Flask class and assign it to a variable, such as app.
- Create an instance of SQLAlchemy class and pass the app variable as an argument, such as db.
- Define your database model using db.Model class and its attributes, such as id, name, picture, etc.
- Use app.route decorator to define the URL path for your function that will handle the logic for changing the profile picture, such as @app.route("/change-picture", methods=["GET", "POST"]).
- In your function, use request.files.get method to get the file object from the input field with id "newPictureInput".
- Use file.save method to save the file to a desired location on your server, such as file.save(os.path.join(app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], file.filename)).
- Use db.session.query method to query the database for the user record that matches the username or id of the current user, such as user = db.session.query(User).filter_by(username=current_user.username).first().
- Update the user.picture attribute with the new file name or path, such as user.picture = file.filename.
- Use db.session.commit method to save the changes to the database, such as db.session.commit().
- Use redirect or render_template methods to return a response to the user, such as redirect(url_for("profile")) or render_template("profile.html", user=user).

Here is an example of how your python code might look like:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for, render_template
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///users.db"
app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"] = "static/images"
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True)
    picture = db.Column(db.String(120))

@app.route("/change-picture", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def change_picture():
    if request.method == "POST":
        file = request.files.get("newPictureInput")
        if file:
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], file.filename))
            user = db.session.query(User).filter_by(username=current_user.username).first()
            user.picture = file.filename
            db.session.commit()
            return redirect(url_for("profile"))
    return render_template("change_picture.html")

@app.route("/profile")
def profile():
    user = db.session.query(User).filter_by(username=current_user.username).first()
    return render_template("profile.html", user=user)
```
